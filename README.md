Project Description: A brief overview of your project, explaining the purpose and goals. You can mention that the project aims to predict the suitable crop based on certain input factors such as soil type, climate conditions, and other relevant parameters.

# Agriculture Crop Prediction

This project aims to predict suitable crops for agriculture based on various input parameters such as soil composition, climate conditions, and other factors. The prediction is done using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in the file "Crop Recommendation.csv". It contains information about different crops along with their characteristics and requirements.

- The dataset contains [number of rows] entries and [number of columns] columns.
- To ensure data quality, the dataset has been checked for any missing values.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): A library for numerical computations in Python.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): A library for data visualization.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): A library for statistical data visualization.
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): A library for machine learning algorithms.


## Run the crop prediction model:
$ python Agriculture_Crop_Predictions.py
Enter the input parameters when prompted, such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

The model will predict the suitable crop based on the provided input parameters.

Machine Learning Model
The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms for crop prediction, including:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
The models have been trained on the provided dataset and evaluated for accuracy.

GUI Application
This project also includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application developed using the Streamlit library. It provides an intuitive interface for users to input the required parameters and obtain crop predictions.

To run the GUI application:

Install the required dependencies mentioned above.

## Run the following command:


$ streamlit run Agriculture_Crop_Predictions.py
Access the application in your web browser at the provided URL.
